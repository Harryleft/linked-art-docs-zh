These align (mostly) with the core classes of the model, and are structured according to the [API design principles](../principles/). \n\n## Endpoints\n\n* [Abstract Works](abstract_work/) - Abstract works, such as the idea for an exhibition\n* [Concepts](concept/) - Types, Materials, Languages, and others, as full records rather than external references\n* [Digital Objects](digital_object/) - Images, services and other digital objects\n* [Events](event/) - Events and other non-specific activities that are related but not part of other entities\n* [Groups](group/) - Groups and Organizations\n* [People](person/) - People\n* [Physical Objects](physical_object/) - Physical things, including artworks, buildings or other architecture, books, parts of objects, and more\n* [Places](place/) - Geographic places\n* [Provenance Activities](provenance_activity/) - The various events that take place during the history of a physical thing\n* [Sets](set/) - Sets, including Collections and sets of objects used for exhibitions\n* [Textual Works](textual_work/) - Texts worthy of description as distinct entities, such as the content carried by a book or journal article\n* [Visual Works](visual_work/) - Image content worthy of description as distinct entities, such as the image shown by a painting or drawing\n\n",
